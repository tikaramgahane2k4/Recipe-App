🍴 Recipe App

The Recipe App is a web application designed to make storing, managing, and searching recipes simple and efficient.
This project was developed as part of Level 2 Hackathon by a team of four members: Tikaram, Dojo, Ravi, and Prashant.

The app provides features to add new recipes, view them in a list, edit, delete, and mark them as favorites. It also shows the total calories of favorite recipes for quick tracking.

🎯 Objective

The main objective of this project was to build a beginner-friendly, fully functional CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while ensuring a clean user interface and smooth user experience.
